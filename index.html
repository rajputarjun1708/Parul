<p style="font-size:150%">I never knew the meaning of true love till the day I met you and having you as my sweetheart is like a dream come true for me.<br>

I become a little weak when it comes to speak my feelings in front of you, so I have thought to pen down my feelings, as I did not want to miss a chance to let you know that you are an angel, my true companion, my best friend and my soulmate. I just wish to tell you that I love you till eternity. I am madly in love with your gentle smile, the spark in your eyes, your warm touch and essence of the bond that we share. I cherish each and every moment spent with you.
